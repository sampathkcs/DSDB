Sampale IDS Rules
Detection of packets from unauthorized IPs:
The UNAUTHORIZED_IPS list holds IP addresses that are considered suspicious. If a packet originates from one of these addresses, an alert is triggered.
Detection of large UDP packets:
The rule checks for UDP packets larger than MAX_PACKET_SIZE (512 bytes in this example). Large packets could indicate an attempt to overwhelm the system with data or buffer overflow attacks.
Detection of packets from a suspicious port range:
If a packet originates from a port in the range 40000-50000, this is flagged as suspicious traffic.
